  <p>My name is Shenghao Dong and I am currently a junior in High School of Telecommunications Art and Technology. My goal is to be a video game programmer in the future and I'm slowly getting to my goal. This summer I participated in SYEP and I worked with a technology company called Clarifi. This was a amazing experience for me, they taught me things like how AI works and how it is trained. This was good for both of us since they gathered data on bugs and I learned more about AI which I didn't know much about before. I'm very proud of the labelling I did this summer since that's what helps AIs run and it was very interesting. Next Summer I would try to do more coding if I could! For other seeking a Summer experience, don't be shy and do your best. The workload may be difficult to adjust to at first but it will become easier the more you do it!</p>
