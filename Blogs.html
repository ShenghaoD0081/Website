  <p>Blog #1</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Today I just began researching 3D Modeling which I have prior knowledge about. I know that 3D Modeling is a big part of gaming and animation.</li>
  <li>I learned that when you are using 3D Models you manipulate points to create the object which is a “mesh”. The points are important because those are what allow you to animate the model you just created.
</li>
  <li>I went on random sites since there was a lot to still learn about 3D Modeling since this is the first time I’m researching about it.
</li>
  <li>A skill I used was communication and collaboration since Gabby who sat next to me was also doing 3D Modeling so I would ask her for advice sometimes since we are doing</li>

  <p>Blog #2</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Today I tried to focus on what jobs 3D Modeling can be used on. Since now I know how 3D models are made I got interested in how they are used by people.</li>
  <li>I learned that 3D Models are also used by doctors to get a closer inspection at a body part. 3D Models can also be used by architects to look at a 3D copy of the city or by clothes designers since they can design clothes digitally to make sure they like them before actually making them. I tried to search for sources that told me what job was and how they were used for. If a source just tells me the job I ignored it.</li>
  <li>A skill that I used was consideration since I had to consider which job truly used 3D Modeling and it is a benefit to them vs ones that can use it as an alternative option.</li>

  <p>Blog #3</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Today I tried to look at the skills needed in 3D Modeling and what you have to learn, since I know who uses and how they use it.</li>
  <li>I learned that 3D Modeling uses Geometry and other kinds of math since you need to be aware of shapes during the 3D modeling process. I also learned that using 3D rendering 2D images can also be created.</li>
  <li>I used sources that talked about people’s personal experience in 3D Modeling because those people know what they need in order to start 3D modeling.</li>
  <li>A skill I used was logical reasoning because many things can be fake on the internet if the site's information didn’t sound right to me I didn’t put it on my docs.</li>

  <p>Blog #4</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Today I tried to look into the types of 3D Modeling and how different industries use them since I got everything else down.</li>
  <li>I learned that different industries use different kinds of 3D Modeling to help them. Most industries use polygon modeling. Polygons are basically the “blocks” in 3D modeling and it determines how good the model is. People sometimes use limited polygons because it’s easier and faster. Games however, need many polygons since polygons directly affect how good graphically the model looks. 3D Models can also be blueprints for 3D printers to print things.</li>
  <li>I used sources that talked about how different people used 3D models and what they used it for.</li>
  <li>The skill I used was how to google because this was very hard since 3D Modeling is usually limited to games and movies and finding other ways to use them was a difficult challenge.</li>
